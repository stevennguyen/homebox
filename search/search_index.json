With a focus on simplicity and ease of use, Homebox is the perfect solution for your home inventory, organization, and management needs. While developing this project I've tried to keep the following principles in mind: Simple - Homebox is designed to be simple and easy to use. No complicated setup or configuration required. Use either a single docker container, or deploy yourself by compiling the binary for your platform of choice. Blazingly Fast - Homebox is written in Go which makes it extremely fast and requires minimal resources to deploy. In general idle memory usage is less than 50MB for the whole container. Portable - Homebox is designed to be portable and run on anywhere. We use SQLite and an embedded Web UI to make it easy to deploy, use, and backup. Project Status Homebox is currently in early-active development and is currently in beta stage. This means that the project may still be unstable and clunky. Overall we are striving to not introduce any breaking changes and have checks in place to ensure migrations and upgrades are smooth. However, we do not guarantee that there will be no breaking changes. We will try to keep the documentation up to date as we make changes. Features Create and Manage Items by provided a name and description - That's it! Homebox requires only a few details to be provided to create an item, after that you can specify as much detail as you want, or hide away some of the things you won't ever need. Optional Details for Items include Warranty Information Sold To Information Purchased From Information Item Identifications (Serial, Model, etc) Categorized Attachments (Images, Manuals, General) Arbitrary/Custom Fields - Coming Soon! Csv Import for quickly creating and managing items - Export Coming Soon! Organize Items by creating Labels and Locations and assigning them to items. Multi-Tenant Support - All users are placed inside of a group and can only see items that are apart of their group. Invite family members to your group, or share an instance among friends! Why Not Use Something Else? There are a lot of great inventory management systems out there, but none of them really fit my needs as a home user. Snipe-IT is a fantastic product that has so many robust features and management options that it's easy to become overwhelmed and confused. I wanted something that was simple and easy to use that didn't require a lot of cognitive overhead to manage. I primarily built this to organize my IOT devices and save my warranty and documentation information in a central, searchable location. Spreadsheet That's a fair point. If your needs can be fulfilled by a Spreadsheet, I'd suggest using that instead. I've found spreadsheets get pretty unwieldy when you have a lot of data and it's hard to keep track of what's where. I also wanted to be able to search and filter my data in a more robust way than a spreadsheet can provide. I also wanted to leave to door open for more advanced features in the future like maintenance logs, moving label generators, and more. Snipe-It? Snipe-It is the gold standard for IT management. If your use-case is to manage consumables and IT physical infrastructure I highly suggest you look at Snipe-It over Homebox, it's just more purpose built for that use case. Homebox is, in contrast, purpose built for the home user, which means that we try to focus on keeping things simple and easy to use. Lowering the friction for creating items and managing them is a key goal of Homebox which means you lose out on some of the more advanced features. In most cases this is a good trade-off.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#project-status","text":"Homebox is currently in early-active development and is currently in beta stage.

The following types are supported: Text Integer (Future) Boolean (Future) Timestamp (Future) Custom fields are appended to the main details section of your item. Tip Homebox Custom Fields also have special support for URLs. Provide a URL ( https://google.com ) and it will be automatically converted to a clickable link in the UI. Optionally, you can also use markdown syntax to add a custom text to the button. [Google](https://google.com) Managing Asset IDs Homebox provides the option to auto-set asset IDs, this is the default behavior. These can be used for tracking assets with printable tags or labels. You can disable this behavior via a command line flag or ENV variable. See configuration for more details. Example ID: 000-001 Asset IDs are partially managed by Homebox, but have a flexible implementation to allow for unique use cases. ID's are non-unique at the database level so there is nothing stopping a user from manually setting duplicate IDs for various items. There are two recommended approaches to manage Asset IDs 1. Auto Incrementing IDs This is the default behavior and likely to one to experience the most consistent behavior. Whenever creating or importing an item, that items receives the next available ID. This is the most consistent approach and is recommended for most users. 2. Auto Incrementing ID's with Reset In some cases you may want to skip some items such as consumables, or items that are loosely tracked. In this case, we recommend that you leave auto-incrementing ID's enabled however when you create a new item that you want to skip, you can go to that item and reset the ID to 0. This will remove it from the auto-incrementing sequence and the next item will receive the next available ID. Tip If you're migrating from an older version there is a action on the users profile page to assign IDs to all items. This will assign the next available ID to all items in the order of creation. You should only do this once during the migration process. You should be especially cautious of this action if you're using the reset feature described in option number 2","title":"Tips and Tricks"},{"location":"tips-tricks/#tips-and-tricks","text":"","title":"Tips and Tricks"},{"location":"tips-tricks/#custom-fields","text":"Custom fields are a great way to add any extra information to your item.
